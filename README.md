This project aimed to see what different uncertainty measures (VIX, EPU, Jurado) reflected, using LDA topics the objective was to see if for example the VIX reacted strongly to financial 
news. 

The Analysis.ipynb contains how I built the datasets for different countries (US, UK, France, Germany) from different sources. 
There is then a class that handles all the data processing, analysis and plotting so that this code is straightforward to use for anyone.

The class contains the linear methods used, OLS and Lasso-OLS, and it plots the results from this analysis in a variety of ways. 
Some examples of the different ways of plotting can be found in the notebook.

The data is mostly open source but I am not fully about posting everything here.
The code is cleaned up but the notebook could be a neater. 1/10/2024
